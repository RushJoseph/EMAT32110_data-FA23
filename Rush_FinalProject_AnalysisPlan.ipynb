    "## Tradeoffs:\n",
    "1.\tHeadshot damage only. It is often reasonable to kill the weak enemies in-game with body shots. Hit zone data does exist for zed kills, but it does not account for prior shots or, in the case of larges, for decapitations before the body was killed. A fleshpound cannot be assumed to have been killed with body shots when it was actually decapitated first and then shot in the chest for the quadruple decapped body multiplier. Additionally, precision play emphasizes headshots, as they are most effective, and for the sake of not expanding the model into intractably unknowable territory, only headshots will be applied to zeds.\n",
    "2.\tMedics excerpted, and they are an extremely valuable part of team eco. They will be assumed for any amount of dosh required for both sharps to load up on w2 EBR and freezes. To include medics, I would need real world wave by wave eco data for them, and I don’t have that. The medic is then assumed to be able to contribute that much dosh to the team’s pool each wave.\n",
    "3.\tAssumes that overkill (wasted) damage and penetration damage roughly cancel each other out. This is not necessarily true in practice, but there is no good way to track them available either in-game or in the accumulated data.\n",
    "4.\tWeighting for zed damage resistances would be best derived from actual wave by wave kills per perk per cycle, but that’s beyond the scope of the easily accessible data.\n",
    "5.\tOnly roughly accounts for target prioritization\n",
    "6.\tCurrently does not account for shared money from kills. I might distribute 40% of large kill dosh across the trinity (mando, sharp 1, slinger 1) to account for some of this, roughly modeling Nausea\n",
    "7.\tGrenade damage for mando & gunslinger not included, since it is incredibly variable\n",
    "8.\tDead-Eye ignored for sharpshooter. Its impact is unreliable, since it depends on individual playstyles, maps, and situations, so its existence is being disregarded.\n",
    "9.\tCost per bullet isn’t quite exact to in-game modeling, since I used cost per magazine and there’s a little more stuff happening under the hood than that, but it’s close enough for this.\n",
    "10.\tThe assumption that all zeds are killed by players is inaccurate to Friendly Fire, particularly in the case of Fleshpounds dealing damage to other zeds while raging or raged. However, zeds also have a chance to rout around the fleshpounds or move out of their way, so the modeling for this is intractable without massive amounts of game data of per wave zed kills by players on any particular cycle. The difference between the population and the players’ kills would give the number of zeds killed by friendly fire.\n",
